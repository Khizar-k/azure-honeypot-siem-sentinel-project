This project is a comprehensive cloud security lab where I deployed a honeypot virtual machine in Azure, collected real-world attacks from the public internet, analyzed the traffic, and built detections within Microsoft Sentinel.

The system simulated standard network services, allowing automated attackers and bots to interact with it. Every connection attempt, brute force attempt, and scan was logged, sent into a SIEM, and reviewed.

This project provided me with hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, Linux administration, attacker behavior, SIEM ingestion, KQL queries, alert creation, and incident handling.
